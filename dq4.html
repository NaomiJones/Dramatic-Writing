  <h4><p><font face="courier"> "I only did about 4 semesters in college so 2 years, but I definitely did grow but mostly by the mistakes I made. First semester I was party girl, second semester I was all in my books and more focused on bringing my GPA up. When I left school the first time it was half way through the second semester and I was basically thrown into adulthood, I worked four jobs at the same time, went to beauty school because I thought it would be a better route, dropped out of that and I was confused and didn’t realize that my education was all I had unless I wanted to get stuck working a job $10 and lower. So I would say leaving school because I thought I could make it without it was my biggest mistake but also lead me to working harder on bettering myself.” </font> </p></h4>

Today I am a man establishing my business, starting my family and reaching the goals I set for myself back then, well at least most of them. I won't mention todays weight or how my hoop dreams don’t extend past the app 'Are They Hooping' that I created. If there was one thing that I learned that stuck with me throughout college it would be the importance of finding a passion and never giving up on that passion."</font></p></h4>
