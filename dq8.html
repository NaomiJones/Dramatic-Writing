  <h4><p><font face="courier"> "My major was journalism but I switched to media communications. I had this deadest vision that I was going to be a sports journalist and marry a basketball player, that’s not why I chose the major but definitely about 75% of the reason. I always knew why I chose it but after taking classes like script writing, broadcast media, and video editing I realized I wanted to be more behind the scenes instead of in front of the screen. I was really good at editing and I had the time to do the internships I wanted I definitely think I would have been satisfied. To this day I still try to use the skills I learned in school even though I'm in a whole different field.” </font> </p></h4>

Due to the nature of my journey my major will provide stability and will lend to my credibility but it was not a requirement for my job. I do believe that my major will help me prepare for the next chapter of my life which is somewhat unknown, but having a degree gives me the confidence that I will be okay.”</font></p></h4>

  <h4><p><font face="courier"> "I started school undecided and quickly changed to a Spanish major since I enjoyed the language. I was never a school fanatic, so I went with what I enjoyed and quickly changed that to a dual major with business to incorporate my dreams of success. Eventually as my personal business grew I explored technology and fell in love with the field. My curiosity, dedication and passion allowed me to grow quickly. Today, I am a computer science major in my senior year and also a senior Developer for a fortune 500 corporation.”</font></p></h4>
